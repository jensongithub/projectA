Finished internationalization(i18n) and form validation on server side.
Create a file called {NAME}_lang.php in application/languages/{LANG}, and load the lang file in your controller by $this->lang->load('{NAME}'), then you may use lang('key') to get the text in specific language. For more details, read the reference below.
